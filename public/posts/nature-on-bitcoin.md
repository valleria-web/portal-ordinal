Nature has always been a source of inspiration for artists, and now with the advent of digital art and blockchain technology, we have a new way to appreciate and preserve the beauty of our natural world. The "Nature on Bitcoin" NFT collection is a stunning example of this, featuring the 30 first pictures ever of nature in Bitcoin. Each of the images in this collection is a masterpiece, capturing the essence of nature.

"The main effect you can see is used to compress the photographs and is called dithering, although other manual touches have been made too. Each image is also limited to 4 colours, which helps reduce the file size even further" Says @NatureOnBitcoin

The calming and cool sensation they evoke is perfect for helping us reconnect with nature, even when we can't be out in it ourselves. These images are not only beautiful but also historic, as they represent the first pictures ever of nature in Bitcoin. This is a significant milestone in the world of digital art, as it shows the potential for blockchain technology to preserve and protect art in a way that has never been possible before.

It's unclear if there were any images of nature in Bitcoin prior to this collection, but regardless, these images are a true testament to the power and potential of blockchain technology. The fact that they are now available as NFTs means that they can be owned and traded securely on the blockchain, ensuring that they will be around for generations to come.

In conclusion, the "Nature on Bitcoin" NFT collection is a stunning and important work of art that showcases the beauty and power of nature and blockchain technology. Whether you're an art lover, a nature enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of digital art, this collection is not to be missed. Be sure to check out the images and experience the wonder and awe of nature in Bitcoin for yourself.
