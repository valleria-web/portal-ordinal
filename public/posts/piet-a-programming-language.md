## Piet a programming language in which programs look like abstract paintings

<img src="/images/piet-ord-000.png" alt="Foto", width="40%", height="40%">

Piet is a unique programming language that challenges traditional notions of what code should look like. Instead of using text, programs in Piet resemble abstract paintings. The language is named after Piet Mondrian, a Dutch painter who was a pioneer in the field of geometric abstract art.

The idea behind Piet is to make programming more accessible to people who may not have a traditional coding background. By using a visual language that is based on color and shapes, anyone can create programs that are both beautiful and functional. Piet also has the added benefit of being able to communicate ideas and concepts that might be difficult to express in traditional code.

The core of Piet's syntax is a grid of colored squares. Each color corresponds to a different command or operation in the language. The program is executed by following a path through the grid, starting at the upper-left corner and moving to the right or down depending on the color of the current square.

The commands in Piet range from simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, to more complex functions like I/O and flow control. The language also includes features for handling errors and exceptions, as well as for creating loops and conditionals.

One of the most interesting aspects of Piet is the way that it forces programmers to think about their code in a different way. Instead of writing out lines of text, they must consider how their program will look as a visual image. This requires a unique set of skills and an eye for design that is not typically associated with programming.

To help programmers create their programs, there are several tools available for generating and editing Piet code. These include online editors, desktop applications, and even mobile apps. These tools allow anyone to experiment with the language and create their own unique programs.

While Piet may not be the most practical language for certain tasks, it is a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between art and technology. By combining the two, Piet opens up new avenues for creativity and expression that were previously unavailable to many people.

In conclusion, Piet is a fascinating programming language that pushes the boundaries of what we think of as code. By using color and shapes to represent commands and operations, it provides a unique and accessible way for anyone to create functional programs that are also works of art. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, Piet is definitely worth exploring as a way to expand your horizons and challenge your creativity.
